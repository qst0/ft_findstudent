```bash
pip install requests --user
pip install simplejson --user
```

Also set the enviorment variables for `FT42_UID` `FT42_SECRET` in `.zshrc`

```bash
FT42_UID=9b735bf8c218efdd93cd7224fefa6f0FAKE05af5cf93daefdd93c13636c37b23
FT42_SECRET=9b735bf8c3afbf8c21871381821670FAKE0256c37b245c5d1d8efdd93c3636c3
export FT42_UID
export FT42_SECRET
```
The `uid` and `secret` have to be your own, get them on [api.intra.42.fr](https://api.intra.42.fr/apidoc)

You will need to reload your .zshrc with `source .zshrc`
